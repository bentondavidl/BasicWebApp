# BasicWebApp

 A stripped down version of a web app written to teach concepts of MVC, APIs, and data processing

## Overview

This package contains a basic web application that will first be written purely in Python using Flask as the backend with mongoDB as the database. It will eventually be refactored to utilize React and keep Flask as an API.

The primary purpose of the application is as an instructional tool to help people better understand how modern web applications are developed.

## Requirements

This package requires that the user has Python3 and MongoDB installed on the host machine. Node will likely be a requirement in the future.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment (this needs to be done every time): `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
4. Install the python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the application: `python app.py`
